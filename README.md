# OpenHealth: A Comprehensive AI Tool for Remote Health Care (Under Development)

In an era where healthcare demands precision, accessibility, and personalised solutions, "OpenHealth" emerges as a ground breaking initiative at the intersection of technology and medicine. This comprehensive project focuses on Multi-Disease Detection, employing a diverse set of algorithms, including traditional machine learning models, deep learning models, transfer learning, and hybrid models such as VGG-19, ResNet50, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting. Diseases across specific organs, such as brain, kidney, heart, liver, and lungs, are accurately predicted, and model performance is rigorously assessed through metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Adding a layer of sophistication, "OpenHealth" integrates with large language models from the Open-source libraries like Hugging Face and GenerativeAI from Google, providing personalised information based on individual health profiles. Furthermore, the project extends its impact by incorporating an AI dietitian and food recommender, tailoring dietary recommendations to individual health conditions. Meticulous organisation is ensured through dedicated directory structures, fostering a modular and maintainable framework. Leveraging Machine Learning operations like Dockers, Data Version Control, and MLflow enhances the overall efficiency and reliability of healthcare systems. In essence, "OpenHealth" represents a transformative force that leverages cutting-edge technologies to usher in a new era of healthcare characterised by accuracy, personalization, and efficiency.
